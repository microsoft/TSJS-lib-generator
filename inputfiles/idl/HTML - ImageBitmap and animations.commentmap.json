These coordinates are in the source image's pixel coordinate space, not in CSS pixels.\n\nIf options is provided, the ImageBitmap object's bitmap data is modified according to options. For example, if the premultiplyAlpha option is set to \"premultiply\", the bitmap data's color channels are premultiplied by its alpha channel.\n\nRejects the promise with an \"InvalidStateError\" DOMException if the source image is not in a valid state (e.g., an img element that hasn't loaded successfully, an ImageBitmap object whose [[Detached]] internal slot value is true, an ImageData object whose data attribute value's [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] internal slot is detached, or a Blob whose data cannot be interpreted as a bitmap image).\n\nRejects the promise with a \"SecurityError\" DOMException if the script is not allowed to access the image data of the source image (e.g. a video that is CORS-cross-origin, or a canvas being drawn on by a script in a worker from another origin).",
